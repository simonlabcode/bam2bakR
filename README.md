# bam2bakR version 1.0.1
This is a Snakemake implementation of a portion of the [TimeLapse pipeline](https://bitbucket.org/mattsimon9/timelapse_pipeline/src/master/) developed by the [Simon lab](https://simonlab.yale.edu/) at Yale. The contributors to the original pipeline are Matthew Simon, Jeremy Schofield, Martin Machyna, Lea Kiefer, and Joshua Zimmer. The original TimeLapse pipeline was developed to process fastq files from TimeLapse-seq (or similar methods, e.g., SLAM-seq, TUC-seq, etc.), map them to a reference genome, and U-to-C or G-to-A mutations in mapped reads. bam2bakR currently includes the basic TimeLapse pipeline functionality downstream of alignment. Thus, the input to bam2bakR is a set of .bam files and the output is a cB.csv file, which as described on the TimeLapse pipeline bitbucket, contains the following columns:
* XF - Mature feature: ENSEMBL ID if the read mapped solely to exonic parts of a feature
* GF - Gene feature: ENSEMBL ID when read is aligned to any part of feature (intronic or exonic)
* rname - Chromosome name
* nT - Number of uridines in read (additional columns are added if considering other types of mutations, like G-to-A mutations)
* TC - Number of called T-to-C mutations in read (additional columns are added for other types of mutations)
* sj - Logical: TRUE if read contains exon-exon spliced junction
* ai - Logical: TRUE if read aligns to any intronic region
* io - Logical: TRUE if read aligns to only intronic regions
* ei - Logical: TRUE if read aligns to intronic and exonic regions
* sample - Sample name
* n - Number of reads which have the identical set of values described above

## Requirements
bam2bakR uses the workflow manager [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). The minimal version of Snakemake is techncially compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux OS, but several of the software dependencies (e.g., HTSeq) are only Mac and Linux compatible. If you are a Windows user like me, don't sweat it, I would suggest looking to the Windows subsystem for linux which can be easily installed (assuming you are running Windows 10 version 2004 or higher).

In addition, you will need Git installed on your system so that you can clone this repository. Head to [this link](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for installation instructions if you don't already have Git.

Finally, bam2bakR requires bam files from stranded library preps (i.e., information about whether a given read represents the original sequence of the RNA or its reverse complement must be retained). In addition, make sure that the aligner you used was configured to output bam files with an MD tag, which will keep track of the reference nucleotide at any mismatches between the aligned read and the reference genome. While this tag is not always included by default, most aligners have an option to add this tag to the list of default tags.

## Setup
There are 5 steps required to get up and running with bam2bakR
1. [Install conda (or mamba) on your system](#conda). This is the package manager that bam2bakR uses to make setting up the necessary dependencies a breeze.
1. [Clone this repository](#clone) to wherever you want to run it from
1. [Install dependencies](#depend) with conda/mamba
1. [Edit the config file](#config) (located in config/ directory of cloned repo) to your liking
1. [Run it!](#run)

The remaining documentation will describe each of these steps in greater detail and point you to additional documentation that might be useful.

### Install conda (or mamba)<a name="conda"></a>
[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) is a package/environment management system. [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a newer, faster, C++ reimplementation of conda. While often associated with Python package management, lots of software, including all of the TimeLapse pipeline dependencies, can be installed with these package managers. They have pretty much the same syntax and can do the same things, so I highly suggest using Mamba in place of conda whenever possible. 

One way to install Mamba is to first install Conda following the instructions at [this link](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). Then you can call:
```
$ conda install -n base -c conda-forge mamba
```
to install Mamba.

A second strategy would be to install Mambaforge, which is similar to something called Miniconda but uses Mamba instead of Conda. I will reproduce the instructions to install Mambaforge below, as this is probably the easiest way to get started with the necessary installation of Mamba. These instructions come from the [Snakemake Getting Started tutorial](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/setup.html), so go to that link if you'd like to see the full original details:

* For Linux users with a 64-bit system, run these two lines of code from the terminal:
``` 
$ curl -L https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh -o Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh
$ bash Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
* For Mac users with x86_64 architecture: 
``` 
$ curl -L https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -o Mambaforge-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
$ bash Mambaforge-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```
* And for Mac users with ARM/M1 architecture:
```
$ curl -L https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-MacOSX-arm64.sh -o Mambaforge-MacOSX-arm64.sh
$ bash Mambaforge-MacOSX-arm64.sh
```

When asked this question:
```
Do you wish the installer to preprend the install location to PATH ...? [yes|no]
```
answer with `yes`. Prepending to PATH means that after closing your current terminal and opening a new one, you can call the `conda` command to install software packages and create isolated environments. We'll be using this in the next two steps.

### Clone bam2bakR<a name="clone"></a>
Clone the bam2bakR repository to wherever you would like on your system. You will eventually be navigating to this repo directory in the terminal and running Snakemake from inside the directory, so make sure your chosen location is conducive to this. Navigate to the directory in the terminal and run:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/simonlabcode/bam2bakR.git
$ cd bam2bakR
```
You should be in the bam2bakR repo directory now!

### Install dependencies<a name="depend"></a>
Inside the repo, you will find a file named `pipeline_env.yaml`. This is a YAML file with the list of exact dependencies that need to be installed to run the Snakemake workflow. Luckily, installation of everything can be completed automatically thanks to Mamba/Conda! If you followed the earlier instructions for installing Mamba, just run:
```
$ conda activate base
$ mamba env create --file pipeline_env.yaml
```
The first line activates the so-called `base` conda environment, which is what allows you to call `mamba` in the next line. This will create a new environment called complete_pipeline. If you don't like that environment name, you can change it by editing the first line of `pipeline_env.yaml`, which looks like:
```
name: complete_pipeline
```
by replacing `complete_pipeline` with the name of your choice! 

To make sure we are all on the same page, an environment is a collection of installed software tucked away in its own directory, separate from everything else installed on your computer. When installing software with Mamba/Conda, I highly suggest installing all of the software you need for a particular task into an isolated environment like this. What's great about it is that you can have multiple versions of any given software installed at the same time! 

Now, whenever you want to run the bam2bakR pipeline, you can just run:

```
$ conda activate complete_pipeline
```
replacing `complete_pipeline` with whatever name you ended up giving the environment, and voila, all of the dependencies are ready to be called upon.

### Edit the config file<a name="config"></a>
In the `config/` directory you will find a file named `config.yaml`. If you open it in a text editor, you will see several parameters which you can alter to your heart's content. The first parameter that you have to set is at the top of the file:

```
samples:
  WT_1: data/samples/WT_replicate_1.bam
  WT_2: data/samples/WT_replicate_2.bam
  WT_ctl: data/samples/WT_nos4U.bam
  KO_1: data/samples/KO_replicate_1.bam
  KO_2: data/samples/KO_replicate_2.bam
  KO_ctl: data/samples/KO_nos4U.bam
```
`samples` is the list of sample IDs and paths to .bam files that you want to process. Delete the existing sample names and paths and add yours. The sample names in this example are `WT_1`, `WT_2`, `WT_ctl`, `KO_1`, `KO_2`, and `KO_ctl`. These are the sample names that will show up in the `sample` column of the output cB.csv file. The `:` is necessary to distinguish the sample name from what follows, the path to the relevant bam file. Note, the path is NOT an absolute path, it is relative to the top of the bam2bakR repo directory. Thus, in this example, the bam files are located in a directory called `samples` that is inside of a directory called `data` located at the top of the bam2bakR directory. Your data can be wherever you want it to be, but it might be easiest if you put it in a `data` directory inside the bam2bakR directory as in this example. 

As another example, imagine that the `data` directory was in the directory that you cloned the bam2bakR repo to, and that there was no `samples` subdirectory inside of `data`. In that case, the paths would look something like this:

```
samples:
  WT_1: ../data/WT_replicate_1.bam
  WT_2: ../data/WT_replicate_2.bam
  WT_ctl: ../data/WT_nos4U.bam
  KO_1: ../data/KO_replicate_1.bam
  KO_2: ../data/KO_replicate_2.bam
  KO_ctl: ../data/KO_nos4U.bam
```
where `../` means navigate up one directory. 

The next parameter you have to set denotes the sample names of any -s4U control samples (i.e., samples that were not fed s4U or a similar metabolic label):

```
control_samples: ["WT_ctl", "KO_ctl"]
```

In this case, the samples named WT_ctl and KO_ctl are the -s4U control samples. -s4U controls will be used to call any single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in your cell line so as to avoid conflating them with T-to-C mutations induced by the nucleotide recoding chemistry. 

The third crucial parmaeter immediately follows:

```
annotation: data/annotation/GRCh38.gtf
```
This is the path to the GTF annotation file for the genome that reads were mapped to. The same rules apply when it comes to specifying this path.

Finally, the path to the genome fasta file that you used for alignment must also be specified:

```
genome_fasta: data/genome/GRCh38.fasta
```

The other parameters that can be altered are:
* `strandedness`: whether the first read in a pair (or the only read if single-end) represents the original sequence of the RNA (F), or its reverse complement (R). For example, set this parameter to "F" if your library is an FR paired-end library, and "R" if it is an RF paired-end library.
* `FORMAT`: whether the reads are paired-end (PE) or single-end (SE).
* `WSL`: whether you are running this on the Windows subsystem for linux (0 = yes; 1= no)
* `mut_tracks`: the type of mutation (e.g., T-to-C mutations) that you are most interested in. If T-to-C, then `mut_tracks` should be TC. If G-to-A, then `mut_tracks` should be GA. If both, then `mut_tracks` should be "TC,GA".
* `minqual`: Minimum base quality to call it a mutation. I wouldn't usually worry about editing this.
* `keepcols`: Names of columns to keep in cB.csv output file. See Output for details of columns you can keep.
* `spikename`: If spike-ins are present, this should be a string that is common to all gene_ids for spike-in transcripts in annotation gtf. For example, in Ensembl annotations for Drosophila melanogaster, all gene_ids start with "FBgn". Therefore, if you have Drosophila spike-ins, `spikename` should be "FBgn".
* `normalize`: If True, then scale factor calculated with edgeR is used to normalize tracks.
 
Edit the values in the config file as necessary and move on to the last step.

### Run it!<a name="run"></a>
Technically, all you need to do to run bam2bakR is activate the pipeline environment and call snakemake from the top of the bam2bakR directory as follows (replacing `complete_pipeline` with whatever you named the environment and `4` replaced with however many cpus you would like to use):
```
$ conda activate complete_pipeline
$ snakemake --cores 4
```
There are **A LOT** of adjustable parameters that you can play with when running a Snakemake pipeline. I would point you to the [Snakemake documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executing/cli.html) 
for the details on everything you can change when running the pipeline.

## Output
All output files will be placed in a directory named `results` that will be created the first time you run bam2bakR. The output of greatest interest, the gzipped cB.csv file, will be in `results/cB/`. Columns that can be kept in the final cB (see the keepcols option in the config to choose among these options) are:
  * qname (read ID)
  * nA (number of As in read)
  * nC (number of Cs)
  * nT (number of Ts)
  * nG (number of Gs)
  * rname (chromosome name)
  * GF (ENSEMBL ID of gene to which read maps)
  * EF (ENSEMBL ID of gene to which read maps if read overlaps any exonic region)
  * XF (ENSEMBL ID of gene to which read maps if read only overlaps with exonic regions)
  * FR (Strandedness of read; F = forward, R = reverse. Only will have F if single-end sequencing)
  * sj (TRUE if read overlaps a splice junction)
  * ai (TRUE if read overlaps any intronic region)
  * io (TRUE if read exclusively overlaps an intronic region)
  * ei (TRUE if read maps to intronic and exonic regions)
  * TA (number of T-to-A mutations)
  * CA (number of C-to-A mutations)
  * GA (number of G-to-A mutations)
  * AT (number of A-to-T mutations)
  * CT (number of C-to-T mutations)
  * GT (number of G-to-T mutations)
  * NT (number of N-to-T mutations, where N is any nucleotide)
  * AC (number of A-to-C mutations)
  * TC (number of T-to-C mutations)
  * GC (number of G-to-C mutations)
  * NC (number of N-to-C mutations, where N is any nucleotide)
  * AG (number of A-to-G mutations)
  * TG (number of T-to-G mutations)
  * CG (number of C-to-G mutations)
  * NG (number of N-to-G mutations, where N is any nucleotide)
  * AN (number of A-to-N mutations, where N is any nucleotide)
  * TN (number of T-to-N mutations, where N is any nucleotide)
  * CN (number of C-to-N mutations, where N is any nucleotide)
  * GN (number of G-to-N mutations, where N is any nucleotide)

The tdf files to make color-coded tracks are in: `results/tracks/`.

Other output includes:
* Sorted and filtered bam file in `results/sf_reads/`
* HTseq output text and bam files in `results/htseq/`
* SNP calls in `results/snps/`
* .csv files with counts of all mutation types in `results/counts/`
* Scale factors calculated with edgeR in `results/normalization/`

## Running bam2bakR with --use-conda

Version 1.0.0 of bam2bakR is now compatible Snakemake's [--use-conda option](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/deployment.html). This will cause Snakemake to automatically create and activate conda environments for each step of the workflow to run inside. If you want to use this functionality, you can replace step 3 of the **Setup** instructions (installing dependencies) with creating a simple conda environment that contains snakemake, as such:

```
mamba create -c conda-forge -c bioconda --name snakemake snakemake
```

You would then run the pipeline with the `snakemake` environment activated (instead of the `complete_pipeline` environment) with:

```
snakemake cores all --use-conda
```

where `cores all` is a convenient way to tell Snakemake to make use of all available cpus (all can be replaced with an explicit number as was shown in the installation/pipeline running instructions above). If you already have the `complete_pipeline` environment created from a previous installation of bam2bakR, you can also run `snakemake cores all --use-conda` from inside of this environment, instead of the minimal `snakemake` environment. If you want to run the pipeline as described in the **Setup** section (i.e., without --use-conda), you will need to ensure that the most up-to-date `complete_pipeline` environment is installed, as a dependency was added in version 1.0.0. If you need to update the environment, it is best to recreate it from scratch as follows (assuming you are in the bam2bakR root directory containing the `pipeline_env.yaml` file):

```
mamba env remove -n complete_pipeline

mamba env create -f pipeline_env.yaml
```

## Running bam2bakR with Snakedeploy

Version 1.0.1 of bam2bakR is now compatible with deployment using the tool [Snakedeploy](https://snakedeploy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). One challenge of using a raw Snakemake workflow like bam2bakR is that updating can be difficult. It often requires renaming the old cloned directory, reclonging the repo into a new directory, moving data into the new directory, and editing the config file. Snakedeploy eliminates a lot of the hassle by creating a new workflow from scratch that uses bam2bakR as a [module](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/modularization.html). This ensures that you are always using the most up-to-date version of bam2bakR. 

Getting started with Snakedeploy involves a similar process as enabling `--use-conda` when running bam2bakR. Steps 1 and 2 of the **Setup** instructions remain unchanged. Step 3 is to create a simple conda environment, this time containing Snakemake and Snakedeploy:

```
mamba create -c conda-forge -c bioconda --name deploy_snakemake snakemake snakedeploy
```

Next, create a directory that you want to run bam2bakR in (I'll refer to it as `workdir`) and move into it:
```
mkdir workdir
cd workdir
```

Now, activate the `deploy_snakemake` environment and deploy the workflow as follows:

```
conda activate deploy_snakemake
snakedeploy deploy-workflow https://github.com/simonlabcode/bam2bakR.git . --branch main
```

`snakedeploy deploy-workflow https://github.com/simonlabcode/bam2bakR.git` copies the content of the `config` directory in the bam2bakR Github repo into the directoy specified (`.`, which means current directory, i.e., `workdir` in this example). It also creates a directory called `workflow` that contains a singular Snakefile that instructs Snakemake to use the workflow hosted on the main branch (that is what `--branch main` determines) of the bam2bakR Github repo. `--branch main` can also be replaced with `--tag 1.0.1` to ensure that you are consistently using the same version of bam2bakR (version 1.0.1 release).

Edit the config and add any data to `workdir` as you see fit (see **Setup** section steps 4 and 5 for more details). Once you are ready, run bam2bakR with:
```
snakemake --cores all --use-conda
```

## Common problems

If there are very few T-to-C mutations in the final cB.csv file (e.g., if sample-wide mutation rates in +s4U samples are < 0.003), then you may have used the incorrect value for the `strandedness` parameter in the config. One way to tell if this is the case is by looking at one of the +s4U sample counts.csv files in `results/counts/` and checking for an abundance of A-to-G mutations. If this is the case, flip the value of `strandedness` to the opposite of whatever you used.

Related to the first point, a good sanity check after running the pipeline is going into R and checking the raw mutation rates as such:

```
library(data.table)

# To unzip and read cB, also need to have R.utils package installed
cB <- fread("path/to/cB.csv.gz")

# Assess sample-wide T-to-C mutation rate in each sample
cB[,.(mutrate = sum(TC*n)/sum(nT*n), by = sample]
  # Want to see that +s4U samples has higher mutation rate than -s4U samples
```

Similarly, checking a counts.csv file for an abundance of A-to-G mutations can be done as follows:

```
library(data.table)

counts <- fread("path/to/+s4U/counts.csv.gz")

## Check if A-to-G mutation rate is higher than T-to-C mutation rate:

# A-to-G mutation rate
sum(counts$AG)/sum(counts$nA)

# T-to-C mutation rate
sum(counts$TC)/sum(counts$nT)
```

## Further automating dependency installation

If you are having trouble installing mamba/conda or creating the required conda environment, you may like to try running bam2bakR inside of a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) container instead. This will automatically install mambaforge, create bam2bakR's conda environment, and even reproduce the exact operating system that I have predominantly tested bam2bakR in. The steps to get up and running with this alternative installation route are:

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). If you are running bam2bakR on a system where you are not the admin (e.g., a shared computing cluster), then you will want to use [Singularity](https://apptainer.org/) (recently changed name to Apptainer) instead. If using Apptainer, just replace `docker` in any code snippet that follows with `apptainer` and you should be good to go!
1. Navigate to the directory where you want to run bam2bakR (i.e., the directory that you will call `snakemake --cores all` or something similar to start the pipeline)
1. Pull the bam2bakr Docker image from Docker Hub by running: `docker pull isaacvock/bam2bakr:v1.0.1`
1. Run the bam2bakr image with a [bind mount](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/06_bind_mounts/). This allows you to have access to all of the files inside your working directory while inside the image's software environment (i.e., Ubuntu + bam2bakR conda environment): 
   ```
   docker run -it --mount type=bind,src="$(pwd)", target=/pipeline isaacvock/bam2bakr:v1.0.1
   ```
1. Activate the conda environment: `conda activate docker_pipeline`
1. Move into the working directory: `cd pipeline`
1. Run bam2bakR: `snakemake --cores all`

When you want to exit the Docker container, hit "Ctrl" + "d". Now everytime you want to run bam2bakR again, you just have to repeat steps 4 through 7.
